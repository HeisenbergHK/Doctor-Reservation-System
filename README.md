# Doctor Reservation System

This is a simple Doctor Reservation System made by Hassan Kalantari

## Getting Started

If you are familiar with Django and have a basic understanding of computer programming with Python then you are completely fine to understand this project.

On the other hand, you need to learn it :)

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3 (No Shit!)
2. Django version 5
3. sqllite3 (This package is already installed with Python 3)

### How To Run

To see the result you need to run the Django project

```
python manage.py runserver
```

After this, you can open the given link in your browser

## Note!

This project only contains the back-end of the project, the front-end is something completly else

This project doesn't have a front-end representation.

## How to Login?

After you enter the URL given to you, in your web browser write "given_url/admin"

This will take you to the admin login page

You need a super user so define a super user for yourself

Go to the terminal and enter the following command:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

After this, you have your own username and password 

### How does the System Work?

you can add new Doctors

You can add new Patients 

you can add new Reservations

All the changes you made directly affect the database

The functionality of the program is working perfectly.


### Database!

There is a folder called database in the src folder that contains the code of the tables

If you are curious about the standardization of the database you can go and check them

I manage the database to be straightforward and understandable
