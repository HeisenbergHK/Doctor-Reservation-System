Doctor Reservation System

This is a simple Doctor Reservation System made by Hassan Kalantari

I used the Django framework to simplify the process of development
If you already work with this framework, then the project schema is straightforward
to run and see the final work you need to run the "mange.py" with the command "python manage.py runserver", after that you can see the result in your web browser
I manage the database to be straightforward
